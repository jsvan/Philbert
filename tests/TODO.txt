1) Tangent software
  X 1a) experiment a) How do tangents of two balls change as radius grows? NOT constant
    1b) experiment b) How does tangent of two balls compare to hilbert ball around line?

2) Interactive plots
    2a) Plotly?
    2b) Hilbert balls around points
    2c) Hilbert balls around lines


Algorithm for finding best dividing line between three points

Algorithm for finding if 3 shapes cross at a point?

Dual:
    Look at all space orange can be in/ how it can move around
    Generate more points, don't just look at three


Three lines intersect:

For three lines of:
    Ax + By + C = 0
if det of:
    |A1 B1 C1|
    |A2 B2 C2|  =  0
    |A3 B3 C3|
