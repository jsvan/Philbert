1) Tangent software
  X 1a) experiment a) How do tangents of two balls change as radius grows? NOT constant
    1b) experiment b) How does tangent of two balls compare to hilbert ball around line?

2) Interactive plots
    2a) Plotly?
    2b) Hilbert balls around points
    2c) Hilbert balls around lines


Algorithm for finding best dividing line between three points
